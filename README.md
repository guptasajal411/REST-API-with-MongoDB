# REST-API-with-MongoDB
This is my first RESTful API made with Node.js and Express.js. The database for this API will be MongoDB Atlas. I tried to use all best practices and routes for a RESTful API.

### /articles
`GET`, `POST` and `DELETE` requests are supported on `articles`.
Don't do `DELETE` requests on `/articles` until you want to delete ALL articles. Issued in public interest ðŸ˜‚
### /articles/articleName
`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests are supported on `/articles/articleName`.

Use **[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)** for loading environmental variables. You can create a new `.env` file to store your MongoDB Atlas's username and password as `usernameMongoDB` and `password` respectively.
